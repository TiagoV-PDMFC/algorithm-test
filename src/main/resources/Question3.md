Following question 2, how would you refactor your previous answer if given an addition boolean parameter:

![Tree Structure](TreeSchema.png?raw=true "Title")

 - when true, calculate the node value in the same way:
 - when false, it's the odd depth nodes that have their value doubled;

Feel free to define any number of additional methods/classes you deem necessary. Code clarity is just as important as the result!
